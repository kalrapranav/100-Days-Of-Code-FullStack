        <div>1) To strengthen their Reconnect program, Dell and Goodwill should take steps to ensure that electronic equipment is
        being recycled in the United States. This could include adding appropriate managers to track all of their e-waste.
        Another way to strengthen their Reconnect program is by partnering with other electronic companies, like Apple or
        Microsoft, to set up even more e-waste bins to further public awareness of recycling their electronic products,

        </div>

        <p>2) The leaders of the United States may feel that this isn’t much of a problem since it is mainly hurting developing
        nations and doesn’t benefit them. Since they are the largest generator of e-waste, the U.S. doesn’t want to dispose of
        e-waste on U.S. soil when it can continue to export it out to smaller countries.
        </p>

        <P>3) On October 23, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce released a proposal that would ban exports of unprocessed e-scraps
        and require stringent tracking procedures for exports that are still allowed. This would prohibit untested, end-of-life
        electronic devices from being exported out of the U.S. Unfortunately, it this was not enacted and companies are still
        free to legally export their e-waste. Despite this, states have enacted their own laws to safely dispose of hazardous
        e-waste. (source:<a class="link-text" href="https://resource-recycling.com/e-scrap/2018/11/01/federal-rule-would-restrict-u-s-e-scrap-exports/)">https://resource-recycling.com/e-scrap/2018/11/01/federal-rule-would-restrict-u-s-e-scrap-exports/)</a>
        </P>

        <p>
            4) (Created Question 1) The United States can implement laws that can prevent the exportation of e-waste to developing
            nations. They could fine companies found guilty of exporting their e-waste. This can help create an effort for companies
            to find ways to safely dispose of e-waste on U.S. land.
        </p>

        <p>
            5) (Created Question 2) Companies can implement e-waste CSR policies by examining whether it is purposeful for them to
            implement it. Electronic companies would greatly benefit from these policies, while paper companies may not. Determining
            whether the company needs these policies is a great way to start implementing this e-waste CSR policy. Within this
            policy, companies can prevent employees and higher ups in their company from throwing away electronic devices. They
            could place e-waste recycling bins to spread their CSR policy throughout the company. Companies will need to makes sure
            to remind employees of this policy to make sure it is being implemented effectively.

    <h1>Akarsh</h1>
    <div>1) To strengthen the “Reconnect program”, i might implement a system of inspections of e-waste. The inspections would be
    scoped around as to if devices are saved or not, to work out if they'll be repaired or refurbished. If they have to be
    recycled, then these product are going to be monitored and escorted to a delegated recycling station that Goodwill and
    dell are related to. there's some primitive person to wherever the merchandise is being sent overseas for use. wherever
    ever this flaw is, observance and escorting each bit or bulk of e-waste can eliminate most cases of waste traveling
    overseas.

    </div>

    <p>2) As US is the largest generator of e-waste worldwide, it is the only industrialized nation that has not yet ratified
    the Basal Convention because US does not want their soil to be affected and they don’t want any disposal of chemicals
    around it. Hence, they export everything to the smaller developing countries.
    </p>

    <P>3) According to the federal exemptions, the electronics wastes from US can be legally exported to developing countries
    from US. But according to RCRA, hazardous waste like cathode ray tube TVs and monitors cannot be exported without the
    consent. According to the EPA rules about the exemption of various kind of e-waste, the export rules do not apply to the
    products like CRT TVs and many other hazardous products and they are being exported as for recycling. Many state have
    waste laws stricter than the federal laws.
    </P>

    <p>
        4) The united states should implement some strict actions and laws against the exportation of e-waste in developing
        countries. It will not prevent those countries from getting from getting exploited. US should find a different way to
        prevent disposing the E-waste on their own land.

    </p>

    <p>
        5) Electronic companies should definitely propose E-waste policies in their CSR because it will not only benefit them
        but the environment. They can also make people aware about not to throw e-waste as it could be harmful. Also, the
        employees should know that disposing e-waste like batteries is harmful and produce toxic gases. Also, special e-waste
        chambers or bins should be installed by the company to counter attack this problem.

    </p>

    <h1>Konark</h1>
    <div>1) To strengthen Dell and Goodwill reconnect program, they should collaborate with other tech companies specifically mobile
    and computer manufacturers. Dell can monitor large number of participants through the use of a simple database system
    that has an ID for each computer being recycled and the person returning the computer for recycling.

    </div>

    <p>2) United States is one of the only countries, while being the largest generator of e-waste which has not yet ratified the
    basel convention because the US doesn’t want the harmful emissions and chemicals being released on its territory which
    is why they export it to other developing countries whose economies benefit from the export but in return their
    environment gets polluted.

    </p>

    <P>3) AB 1419 is a federal law passed by the state of California in 2018 which reduces the environmental risk inherent in the
    stockpiling and export of glass from monitors and televisions, by allowing scrap CRT panel glass to be used in many new
    products where it is determined to pose no harm, including tile and radiation shielding glass.

    </P>

        4) The united states should implement some strict actions and laws against the exportation of e-waste in

        way to
        prevent disposing the E-waste on their own land.

        them
        but the environment. They can also make people aware about not to throw e-waste as it could be harmful. Also,
        the
        employees should know that disposing e-waste like batteries is harmful and produce toxic gases. Also, special

    <h1>Pratik</h1>
    <div>1) In order to strengthen the Reconnect Program, companies like Dell and Goodwill must recycle their waste within the
    United States instead of shipping it to the developing countries like India, China, Pakistan, the Philippines, and
    Vietnam. It is important that companies should have a department which is allocated to keep a track on their e-waste. I
    believe that collaborating with different electronic companies would help them.

    </div>

    <p>2) United States, being one of the largest generator of e-waste do not keep their waste within their country, but instead
    they ship their e-waste to developing countries.

    </p>

    <P>3) Members of Congress introduced a bill called the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act (RERA), which would make it
    illegal to send toxic e-waste from the U.S to developing nations. But despite bipartisan support in the House, the
    subcommittee chair would not schedule the bill for hearing.

    </P>

    <p>
        4) I believe that United States should set up a department especially for looking over the companies if anybody is shipping
        the e-waste outside the country. If any company is found dumping their e-waste outside the country then they should be
        fined and serious action should be taken against them.


    </p>

    <p>
        5) Electronic companies should definitely propose E-waste policies in their CSR because it will not only benefit
        them
        but the environment. They can also make people aware about not to throw e-waste as it could be harmful. Also,
        the
        employees should know that disposing e-waste like batteries is harmful and produce toxic gases. Also, special
        e-waste
        chambers or bins should be installed by the company to counter attack this problem.

    <h1>Pranav Kalra</h1>
    <div>1) Dell and Goodwill can Consider the following Strategies:
    Compost | Audit their Facility | Reduce Packaging | Eliminate Bottled Water | Give Food Waste to Pigs | Reduce Paper
    Consumption | Measure Their E-Waste
    > Dell can use the one-to-one matching program like many companies do towards donations at NGO’s , where they can alter
    it to do a one-to-one E-waste matching as they every employee can monitor their waste production and company can have a
    reward program in return


    </div>

    <p>2) I believe that its because US is the largest producer of E-Waste so If they follow the Basal Convention they wont be
    able to send their waste to other countries. As, the number of tech companies in US rise a lot so this waste produce
    wont reduce and being aware of that fact they would not want to stop the waste in their own Country.
    </p>

    <P>After some research I was able to find out that according to the federal exemptions, the electronics wastes from US can
    be legally exported to developing countries from US. But according to RCRA, hazardous waste like cathode ray tube TVs
    and monitors cannot be exported without the consent. According to the EPA rules about the exemption of various kind of
    e-waste, the export rules do not apply to the products like CRT TVs and many other hazardous products and they are being
    exported as for recycling. Many state have waste laws stricter than the federal laws.
    </P>

    <p>
        4) United States can work on building suitable sites for recycling purposes, although it is going to cost more than
        exporting the e waste to developing countries in long term it's a much viable option

    </p>

    <p>
        5) Companies can use E-waste policies in their CSR if they implement recycling as a part of a ethical code the organization
        should pursue and maybe set goals to award people based on their recycling goals.
