        <h1>Akarsh</h1>
        <div>After reading the article I had a lot of questions and explanations about my case study. I think that there should be a
        system of inspections of e-waste. The inspections would be scoped around as to if devices are saved or not, to work out
        if they'll be repaired or refurbished. If they have to be recycled, then these products are going to be monitored and
        escorted to a delegated recycling station that Goodwill and dell are related to.

        </div>

        <p>Also, I read some federal laws regarding the E-waste and found out that the electronics wastes from the US can be
        legally exported to developing countries from the US. But according to RCRA, hazardous waste like cathode ray tube TVs
        and monitors cannot be exported without the consent. According to the EPA rules about the exemption of various kind of
        e-waste, the export rules do not apply to the products like CRT TVs and many other hazardous products and they are being
        exported as for recycling. Many states have waste laws stricter than federal laws.

        </p>

        <P>I think that The united states should implement some strict actions and laws against the exportation of e-waste in
        developing countries. It will not prevent those countries from getting exploited. The US should find a different way to
        prevent disposing of the E-waste on their own land.

        </P>

        <h1>Pranav</h1>
        <div>After Reading the article I went to research more about the different initiatives are taken by different companies to
        reduce their E-waste production and its reduction. I was amused to look up Nokia's CSR program as thsi text snippet is
        from their website that, "
        To recycle your waste electronic items, all you have to do is drop an email at <a href="engage@karosambhav.com">engage@karosambhav.com</a> with details of
        each type of Waste Electrical or Electronic device and your city. You will receive a reply within 48 hours of your email
        with further details.
        </div>

        <p>You can also visit our <a href="http://karosambhav.com/collection-points/" >collection points</a> directly to drop off the e-waste and get more information on the subject. You
        can also call our toll-free number 1800 2121 434.
        Going beyond just recycling: At HMD Mobile India Private Limited, we believe that our focus should not only be on
        responsible recycling, but also on generating livelihood for people involved in the e-waste management chain."
        </p>

        <P>This shows if a company wants they can have wonderful programs to reduce its E-waste. I believe that other companies
        should take a lesson from Nokia as many other companies such as Apple, who have been criticized for their E-waste
        production can take a step towards stopping it.

        <h1>Omar</h1>
        <div>Our case study gave me a lot of insight into how the international community has been handling e-waste and its
        exportation to developing nations. In these developing nations, when disposing of e-waste it is not done in an
        “environmentally sound manner”, which the emissions from this can cause health problems and affect the environment.
        While there has been some good steps taken to ensure that e-waste is safely disposed of, like the Basal Convention,
        there is still more to be done when it comes to dealing with this issue.
        </div>

        <p>For one, the United States needs to wake up and ratify the Basal Convention, like other countries have done, to ensure
        that e-waste is being safely disposed within their country rather than being exported to developing countries. States in
        the U.S. have taken their own steps to ensure e-waste is safely disposed of which is a good step in the right direction.
        Companies like Dell and Goodwill have also taken the initiative of banning e-waste exportation and have been collecting
        e-waste from customers by having e-waste recycling bins in Goodwill stores. This is a good example of a company
        understanding what e-waste does to the world and what steps we should be taking to prevent e-waste problems. There is
        still much to be done with the world of e-waste, but when companies, states, or countries take the appropriate measures
        to safely dispose of e-waste, it makes the world a better place for everyone.

        <h1>Konark</h1>
        <div>An important global environment and health issue
        Everyone in my group decided to pick the case study about E-Waste as this is a major issue in our society which we knew
        that not everyone is familiar with. In this case study we got to learn more about what E-waste means, how it differs
        from other types of chemical waste. How much E-waste is produced globally in a year (around 46 million tons), how it can
        harm the environment and how it affects our health if it is not disposed or recycled correctly.
        We also got to learn how US corporations like Dell and Goodwill have successfully recycled over 1 million E-waste
        products within a year.

        <h1>Pratik</h1>
        <div>After going through this article, we have an understanding about the electronic waste (e-waste) and how companies from
        different countries are handling it. E-Waste is basically a term for electronics who are old and discarded electronic
        devices. Over 46 million tons of e-waste is produced all over the world and 50-80 percent of that is shipped to
        developing countries like China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and the Vietnam.
    
        </div>
    
        <p>For recycling e-waste, it is important to do it safely but in such developing countries proper measures are not taken
        which is harmful to the environment and human beings. It is high time that United States ratify the Basal Convention so
        that safe decomposing of e-waste can be carried out within the country instead of sending it to other countries and
        letting them suffer. Couple companies like Dell and Goodwill, which are US based companies have banned exporting their
        e-waste. These 2 companies have set a good example to all the companies in the world to follow this path as they have
        been recycling their old products by collecting it from customers who do not use them.

    
        </p>
    
        <P>I believe that companies who do still export their e-waste out of the country should be heavily fined and strict laws
        should be put in place by the government to make sure that those who breaks the law are punished.
